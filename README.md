All of my original code is released under GPLv2.  Everyone else's, as noted in the credits section, is licensed under whatever they license it under.

### Summation

In short, this is nothing by itself.  It is simply a building block to let folks building webapps and the like have a handy admin panel with which to administrate what they've built, rather than having to waste time or money building or buying one.

It has a simple plugin architecture, along with two included plugins (so far, more to come) to serve as examples of the structure and methods.
